\title{Potential Outcomes}
\usage{
potential_outcomes(object, outcome, treatment)

randomize_sevt(object, treatment, p = NULL, ignore = object$name_unobserved)
}
\arguments{
\item{object}{a fitted object of class \code{sevt}.}

\item{outcome}{the outcome variable.}

\item{treatment}{the treatment variable.}

\item{p}{the probabilities of treatment}

\item{ignore}{name of stages to be ignored}
}
\value{
a matrix with potential outcomes.
}
\description{
Compute potential outcomes by randomizing
the treatment variable on the given model.
}
\details{
The \code{potential_outcome} function \emph{randomize}
the treatment variable in
the given staged event tree with the \code{randomize_sevt}
function and then compute the conditional probabilities
of the outcome variable given the values of the
treatment variable.

The \code{randomize_sevt} function builds the
staged event tree associated with a randomized experiment over

\examples{
model <- stages_bhc(full(Titanic))
potential_outcomes(model, "Survived", "Class")
}
